## 1. NFPA 701: Standard Methods of Fire Tests for Flame Propagation of Textiles and Films

### Overview
NFPA 701 is specifically designed for testing **textiles and films** such as curtains, draperies, and other decorative fabrics. The standard includes two distinct test methods based on material weight.

**Current Version:** 2023 Edition

### Test Method 1

**Applicability:** Materials with an areal density **≤ 700 g/m² (21 oz/yd²)**

**Specimen Size:** Ten specimens, each **150 mm x 400 mm** (approximately 6" x 16"), with length parallel to the lengthwise direction of the material

**Flame Exposure:**
- Flame source: Bunsen burner with specific gas mixture
- Flame height: Typically 1.5 inches (38 mm)
- Exposure duration: **12 seconds**
- Application: Flame applied to bottom edge of vertically mounted fabric strip

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- After-flame time measured
- Char length measured
- Specific thresholds must be met for compliance

### Test Method 2

**Applicability:** Denser, multilayer fabrics, plastic films, lined curtains, vinyl-coated fabrics

**Specimen Size:** **5 feet x 2 feet (1.5 m x 0.6 m)** - significantly larger than Method 1

**Flame Exposure:**
- Flame source: 11-inch (279 mm) ribbon burner
- Exposure duration: **2 minutes** (10x longer than Method 1)
- Application: Flame applied to bottom edge of vertically mounted specimen

**Key Difference:** Method 2 uses larger specimens and longer flame exposure to better assess heavier and more complex fabric assemblies.

## 2. ASTM E84: Standard Test Method for Surface Burning Characteristics (Steiner Tunnel Test)

### Overview
ASTM E84, also known as the **Steiner Tunnel Test**, has been North America's standard method for testing building materials since the mid-1940s. This test evaluates a material's surface burning characteristics.

**Also Known As:** UL 723, NFPA 255 (equivalent standards)

### What It Measures

**Two Primary Indices:**

1. **Flame Spread Index (FSI)** - Quantifies the rate and extent of flame spread across the material's surface
2. **Smoke Developed Index (SDI)** - Measures the amount of smoke produced during combustion

### Test Procedure

**Equipment:** 25-foot-long tunnel lined with fire-resistant materials

**Sample Mounting:** Material sample mounted to the **ceiling** of the tunnel

**Test Duration:** **10 minutes**

**Flame Application:** Gas flame applied to one end of the sample

**Reference Standards:**
- Red oak: FSI = 100 (reference baseline)
- Fiber cement board: FSI = 0 (non-combustible reference)

### Classification System

**Class A (Most Fire-Resistant):**
- Flame Spread Index (FSI): **0-25**
- Smoke Developed Index (SDI): **0-450**

**Class B (Moderate Fire Resistance):**
- Flame Spread Index (FSI): **26-75**
- Smoke Developed Index (SDI): **0-450**

**Class C (Least Fire-Resistant):**
- Flame Spread Index (FSI): **76-200**
- Smoke Developed Index (SDI): **0-450**

**Note:** The SDI limit of 450 is **universal across all classes** as required by IBC Section 803.1 for interior wall and ceiling finishes.

## 3. NFPA 701 vs. ASTM E84: Key Differences and When to Use Each

### Primary Applications

**NFPA 701:**
- **Purpose:** Specifically for textiles and films
- **Common Uses:** Curtains, draperies, hanging decorative fabrics, banners
- **Test Method:** Vertical flame test with fabric mounted vertically
- **Regulatory Context:** Required for decorative materials in IFC (International Fire Code)

**ASTM E84:**
- **Purpose:** Building materials and interior finishes
- **Common Uses:** Wall coverings, ceiling panels, insulation, laminates, broad range of construction materials
- **Test Method:** Horizontal tunnel test with material mounted on ceiling
- **Regulatory Context:** Primary standard for classifying interior wall and ceiling finishes in IBC

### Testing Methodology Differences

**NFPA 701 (Vertical Flame Test):**
- Fabric mounted **vertically**
- Flame applied from **below** for specified time
- Measures: After-flame time, char length
- Scale: Small specimens (Method 1) or larger panels (Method 2)

**ASTM E84 (Tunnel Test):**
- Material mounted on **ceiling** (horizontal orientation)
- Flame applied from one end of 25-foot tunnel
- Measures: Flame spread rate, smoke density
- Scale: Large-scale test over 10 minutes

### When to Use Which Standard

**Use NFPA 701 when:**
- Testing textiles, curtains, draperies, or films
- Material will be hung or draped (not adhered to wall/ceiling)
- Required by local fire marshal for decorative materials

**Use ASTM E84 when:**
- Testing interior wall or ceiling finishes
- Material will be permanently installed on building surfaces
- Building code requires specific Class A/B/C rating
- Testing broader construction materials beyond textiles

**Summary:** Select NFPA 701 for textiles and decorative materials; select ASTM E84 for interior finishes and construction materials.

## 4. International Building Code (IBC) Interior Finish Requirements

### Primary Standard Reference

**IBC Chapter 8: Interior Finishes** governs requirements for interior wall and ceiling finishes.

### ASTM E84 Classification Requirements

Interior wall and ceiling finishes must be **classified in accordance with ASTM E84 or UL 723**.

**Classification Criteria:**
- **Class A:** FSI 0-25, SDI 0-450
- **Class B:** FSI 26-75, SDI 0-450
- **Class C:** FSI 76-200, SDI 0-450

### Alternative Testing Method

**NFPA 286** may be used as an alternative test method. Materials meeting NFPA 286 acceptance criteria are permitted where Class A classification per ASTM E84 is required.

### Decorative Materials (IFC Reference)

The **International Fire Code (IFC)** requires **decorative materials applied over interior finishes** to comply with **NFPA 701**.

- Decorative materials must meet Test Method 1 or Test Method 2 of NFPA 701
- These are materials **applied over** the base interior finish (not the finish itself)

### Safety Restrictions

**Exits, exit lights, fire alarm stations, wet standpipe hose cabinets, and fire extinguisher locations shall NOT be concealed** (in whole or part) by decorative materials.

## 5. Other Relevant Fire Safety Standards

### California Title 19

**Purpose:** Establishes minimum standards for fire prevention and life safety through flame-retardant materials.

**Scope:** California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 1, Chapter 8

**Decorative Material Requirements:**

In Group **A, E, I, R-1, R-2, R-2.1, R-3.1, and R-4 Occupancies**, all drapes, hangings, curtains, drops, and decorative materials (including Christmas trees) must:
