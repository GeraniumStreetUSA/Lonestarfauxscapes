## Plan

### Research Tasks

- [ ] 1. Research real water rates for major Texas cities (Dallas, Houston, Austin, San Antonio)
- [ ] 2. Research Texas drought conditions and water restriction data from TWDB/TCEQ
- [ ] 3. Research commercial landscaping maintenance costs in Texas from NAA/IREM sources
- [ ] 4. Research irrigation water usage data from EPA, USGS, Texas A&M AgriLife Extension
- [ ] 5. Research property value and tenant satisfaction data related to landscaping
- [ ] 6. Compile all findings with verified source URLs

### Deliverable

Create structured document with:
- Real water rates with specific per-1000-gallon costs
- Verifiable drought statistics from government sources
- Real landscaping maintenance cost data
- Irrigation water usage statistics
- Property value impact data from real estate research
- All source URLs clearly documented
- "Data not found" notation where exact numbers unavailable

## Work Log

### Initial Research Completed
- Conducted comprehensive web searches for all major data categories
- Found verifiable data for Austin water rates with specific per-1,000-gallon tiers
- Found general range data for Dallas, Houston, San Antonio (exact 2026 rates limited)
- Found TWDB drought statistics showing 74% of Texas in drought as of Feb 2026
- Found EPA/USGS outdoor water usage data
- Found property value impact studies showing 5-20% increase from quality landscaping
- Found landscaping maintenance cost ranges (but limited per-unit multifamily data)
- Noted limitations: Some exact 2026 rate schedules not fully available in search results

### Final Compilation Completed
- Created comprehensive data document: texas-water-landscaping-roi-data.md

## Review

### Summary of Research Findings

**Successfully Verified Data:**
1. **Austin Water Rates**: Complete tiered pricing ($3.27-$10.26 per 1,000 gallons based on usage)
2. **Texas Drought Conditions**: 74% of Texas in drought as of February 2026 (TWDB data)
3. **Historical Drought Context**: At least one serious drought per decade in 20th century
4. **National Irrigation Usage**: Nearly 9 billion gallons/day for landscape irrigation
5. **Texas-Specific Usage**: 25% of urban water supply goes to landscapes (Texas A&M)
6. **Property Value Impact**: 5-20% increase from quality landscaping (multiple studies)
7. **Landscaping Maintenance Costs**: $600-850/month range for North Texas

**Data Limitations:**
1. Dallas, Houston, San Antonio exact 2026 per-1,000-gallon rates not fully available in public search
2. Specific per-unit multifamily landscaping costs require NAA/IREM subscription
3. Texas-specific commercial irrigation usage data not found
4. Quantitative tenant satisfaction data specific to Texas multifamily landscaping not available

**Key Takeaway:**
Research found substantial REAL, VERIFIABLE data from authoritative sources (TWDB, TCEQ, EPA, USGS, Texas A&M, Virginia Tech, American Society of Landscape Architects). No data was fabricated. Where exact figures were unavailable, this was clearly noted with guidance on how to obtain them.
