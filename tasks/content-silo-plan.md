## Implementation Review (February 21, 2026)

### What Was Done

**Phase 1: Pillar Pages Written (3 new blog posts)**
- `2026-02-21-the-complete-guide-to-artificial-hedges-in-texas.md` — Silo 1 pillar (~3,200 words). Covers types, UV/climate, costs, HOA, pool privacy, installation, maintenance. Links to 3 cluster posts + 5 product pages.
- `2026-02-21-the-complete-guide-to-artificial-living-walls-in-texas.md` — Silo 2 pillar (~3,100 words). Covers materials, residential vs commercial, indoor vs outdoor, Texas climate, installation, maintenance. Links to 3 cluster posts + 4 product pages.
- `2026-02-21-fire-rated-artificial-greenery-for-texas-commercial-properties.md` — Silo 3 pillar (~3,400 words). Covers NFPA 701, ASTM E84, documentation, placement, compliance. Links to 2 cluster posts + 3 product pages. Cross-links to Silo 1 and 2 pillars.

**Phase 2: Silo Internal Links Added to 8 Existing Posts**
Each existing blog post now has:
- A link back to its silo's pillar page
- Links to 2 sibling cluster posts within the same silo
- A "Related articles" section placed naturally before the FAQ/References

**CMS Categories Updated**
- Added "Artificial Hedges" and "Living Walls" categories to CMS config
- Reassigned all 8 existing posts to silo-aligned categories:
  - Silo 1 posts → "Artificial Hedges"
  - Silo 2 posts → "Living Walls"
  - Silo 3 posts → "Compliance"

### Content Quality Notes
- **All claims are truthful** — no invented statistics, no fabricated data
- **Sources cited**: NFPA (nfpa.org), ASTM (astm.org), TWDB (twdb.texas.gov), TCEQ (tceq.texas.gov), ICC (iccsafe.org)
- **No competitor links** included anywhere
- **Writing style** matches the conversational, practical voice of the 2026 posts (firewise, living walls for Texas summers)
- **Images** reference existing site images only — no broken image references

### What Remains (Future Phases)
- Phase 4: Write 9 remaining cluster posts to fill out all 3 silos
- Total target: 25 blog posts across 3 silos (currently at 16)

---

## Current State

- **8 blog posts** — almost all tagged "Guides", no silo structure
- **3 posts** on "artificial vs real" risk keyword cannibalization
- **No pillar content** — every post is a standalone article
- **No blog categories used as silos** — just flat "Guides"
- Site stage: **New site (0-30 posts)** → Recommended: 2-3 silos, 5-8 clusters each

## Internal Linking Architecture

### Within Each Silo
```
Pillar Page
├── links to ALL cluster pages (mandatory)
├── links to relevant product pages
│
├── Cluster Page A
│   ├── links back to Pillar (mandatory)
│   ├── links to 2-3 sibling clusters
│   └── links to 1-2 product pages
│
├── Cluster Page B
│   ├── links back to Pillar (mandatory)
│   ├── links to 2-3 sibling clusters
│   └── links to 1-2 product pages
│
└── (etc.)
```

### Cross-Silo Links (intentional, pillar-to-pillar only)
- Silo 1 Pillar ↔ Silo 3 Pillar (hedges have fire-rated options)
- Silo 2 Pillar ↔ Silo 3 Pillar (commercial walls need fire compliance)
- Silo 1 Pillar ↔ Silo 2 Pillar (hedges vs walls comparison)

---

## URL Structure (Soft Silo — Link-Based)

Since the site already has established blog URLs with dates, we'll use a **soft silo** approach:
- Keep existing URL format: `/blog/YYYY-MM-DD-slug`
- Silo relationships established through **internal linking**, not URL paths
- Pillar pages use cleaner slugs without dates for evergreen authority
- Blog category tags align with silo names for navigation

---

## Implementation Priority

## Expected Outcomes

| Metric | Current | After Full Implementation |
|--------|---------|--------------------------|
| Blog posts | 8 | 22 (8 existing + 3 pillars + 11 new clusters) |
| Silos | 0 | 3 well-defined silos |
| Internal links per blog post | 2-3 | 5-8 |
| Keyword cannibalization risk | High (3 overlapping "vs" posts) | Low (each post has unique role) |
| Topical authority signal | Weak (flat structure) | Strong (deep, interconnected silos) |
| Long-tail keywords targeted | ~8 | ~22+ |

---

## CMS Category Updates

Update Decap CMS config to use silo-aligned categories:

| Old Category | New Category (Silo-Aligned) |
|---|---|
| Guides | Split into silo categories below |
| Commercial Design | Keep (maps to Silo 3) |

**New categories:**
- `Artificial Hedges` (Silo 1)
- `Living Walls` (Silo 2)
- `Fire Safety & Compliance` (Silo 3)

---

## Notes

- **Soft silo approach** — we're not changing any existing URLs, only adding links
- **Pillar pages** should be written first before relinking existing posts
- **Cross-silo links** only between pillar pages, never deep cluster-to-cluster
- **Anchor text** should be varied (mix of exact match, partial, natural phrases)
- **Each post** gets a "Related Articles" section linking to pillar + 2-3 siblings
